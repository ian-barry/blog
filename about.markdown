Hi, I'm software engineer with expertise in .net, domain driven design and architecture. I like to write clean and reusable code. I spent much of the time in naming things. Sometimes I get them right :).

I'm a father of three gorgeous boy's and on my free time I like to read books about programming and try new stuff.
